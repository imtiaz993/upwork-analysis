            "Hello Upworkers!\n\nUsual spiel about AI and copy pasting; if you do either, we'll need to reject your application without review. Save your credits by spending just a few minutes responding directly to each of our questions/requirements! First impressions count.\n\nToday we have an opportunity for a Frontend React developer to join us on our journey. We are not seeking agencies at this time. You may be working with other developers, or required to work independently, under the guidance of a project lead.\n\nYou must be confident with React, (TypeScript) and Tailwind, with the potential to handle API integration depending on your experience (this may involve REST or GraphQL). Experience with ReactNative is a bonus - please mention it in your application only if you have practical experience. Our designs are primarily in Figma, which you'll need to convert to code using Atomic design and ensure our great UI/UX is projected through compatibility across a range of devices.\n\nThe ability to communicate effectively in English and understand our project/task requirements is also crucial; when you push code, it's expected that you've tested it and tried to resolve any bugs/issues which may exist first (we'll also perform our own testing on top of this).\n\nAll of our work is fixed-price. This posting is for a sample scope which we will discuss with you in more detail, if you're shortlisted. If successful with this sample project, you may be assigned ongoing frontend/backend work for the next several months. We are a startup, so budget is crucial to us.\n\nLooking forward to working with one of you!\n\n[DEV-UW#22FE]",
